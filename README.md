**About Walmart**
Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.

The company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from the Walmart Stores during Black Friday. The dataset has the following features:
